## Talk
In this workshop, you will identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. We will be building an end to end data science solution to build effective detectors and classifiers for analyzing complex soundscape recordings using TensorFlow 2.0 and TPU as runtime accelerators .
